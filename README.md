# final_project_spring22-
hi. my plan for my final prject was to create an app that is like a review website that is able to allow people to input classes that they have taken and right a review about the courses they have taken.
i wanted to create something like this because we are constantly thinking about what professor is teaching the class and forgetting about what they actual course will be like.
Creating my app was a lot becaue it required learning a new coding language which wsnt to bad but in the end i was not able to show entirely what i had envison for the project which was disapponting. 
overall after rewrtting my code multiples , watching instruction videos to manuver through the app I leanred quite a lot and with more pratice i woukd be excute my app to its full potential like how i had envisoned.
